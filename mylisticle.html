<p>Your 20's can sometimes be very difficult to navigate. Between the presures of work, making career choice and chosing friends, all of which will most likely follow you for the rest of your life. Having to navigate through all of this at such a young age, you can't help but feel a little lost.<br><br>
Things like looking through your closet and realising that nothing really speaks to you anymore, it is this uncomparable feeling that you have never felt before. <br><br>
School is by far one of the places where you will feel the most LOST... Having to make a "forever" career choice at only the age of 20, is a lot of presure for an individual who's just starting to figure out who they are. All of your prior guidance was given to you by adults, but you're an adult now...  In college and in university the safety net beneath you has be cut and you're on you're on your own kid. <br></p>

<p>Ohhh money... If you think you didn't have money when you were young , think again because in your 20's it's a whole new ball game. Between the bills, the food, the acitivies/outtings and the gifts, it can sometimes mean that you might just have to split that last piece of toast with your roommate while waiting for pay day.<br> <br> It is crutial for a lot of young adults to focus mainly on school and save money by staying at home with their parents, though it can be difficult to remain in the same household for longer than you expected. It will help you down the line by keeping your debt low and you focus on the right things...Like School.</p>

<p>When it comes to making difficult decisions... your 20's has to top it all. Choosing your school, program, friends and living situation are but the tip of the iceberg of the decision mountain that you will face in your 20's. The friends that you used to get along with so well has now started to driff away... This is normal and it's called growing up.<br> <br> You won't have all of the answers right away, but that's what your 20's is all about (i.e. figuring out what you want, what you need and what you love).</p>

<h2>Expectation vs Reality</h2>
<p>I'm sure you remember when you were young and thought to yourself... "Man, I can't wait till I'm all grown up!<br> <bar> Well, here you are, all grown up... Is it all you've ever hoped for?/p>
